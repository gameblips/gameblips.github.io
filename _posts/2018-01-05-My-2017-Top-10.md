2017 came and went as did many games. Perusual, here are my choices for the year that are centered around what I played in the year, not based on it's release date.
* 10 - BattleBorn (PS4) 
* 9 - Friday The 13th (PS4)  
* 8 - Destiny 2 (Xbone/PC)  
* 7 - Puyo Puyo Tetris (PS4)  
* 6 - Rocksmith 2014: Remastered Edition (Xbone/PC)  
* 5 - Dead Ahead: Zombie Warfare (Android)  
* 4 - Fortnite: Battle Royale (PS4)  
* 3 - Cat Quest (Android)  
* 2 - Puzzle Fighter (Android)  
* 1 - Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp (Android)
