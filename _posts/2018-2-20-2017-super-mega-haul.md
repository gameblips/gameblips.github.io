THUMBNAIL Last year was an odd one with video releases. I was going strong for a long time with adding new content to the YouTube channel but then things got busy and since monitization there is not available, I put YouTube priority on the back burner. Fast foward to how Twitch/Amazon is offering a new curated content option for those on their platform. As an Affiliate, I decided to take this option up and try it out!

Today's post is the second video of the year premiering on Twitch! Come check out the <b>2017 Super Mega Haul</b> hitting the site, tonight, at 5:30p CST at <a href="">https://www.twitch.tv/gameblips</a>!

If you happened to miss out on the last Twitch Premiere, you can check it out <a href="">here</a>!
